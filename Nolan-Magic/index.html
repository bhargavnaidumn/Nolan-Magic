                        <h3>Prestige</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Prestige is a 2006 science fiction mystery thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan,
                            written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, based on the 1995 novel of the same name by
                            Christopher Priest. It follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in
                            London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they
                            engage in competitive one-upmanship, with fatal results.

                            The film stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden. It also
                            stars Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis, Rebecca Hall, and David
                            Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins
                            and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, and editor
                            Lee Smith.Angier and Borden launch their own magic careers, with Angier working with Cutter,
                            and Borden with the mysterious Fallon. Angier sabotages one of Borden's performances when he
                            slips a real bullet into Borden's pistol during a bullet-catch trick, resulting in Borden
                            losing two of his fingers. Borden reciprocates by sabotaging Angier's disappearing bird act,
                            killing the bird on stage and injuring a volunteer from the audience. Borden develops a
                            trick he calls the Transported Man, in which he appears to travel instantly between two
                            wardrobes on opposite ends of the stage. Unable to discern Borden's method, Angier hires a
                            double, Gerald Root, to perform his own version of the trick. The imitation is a greater
                            success, but Angier is dissatisfied, as he ends the trick hidden under the stage while Root
                            basks in the applause.

                            Angier has his assistant, Olivia, spy on Borden to learn how he performs the Transported
                            Man. However, Olivia falls in love with Borden and becomes his assistant. With her help,
                            Borden sabotages Angier's act, crippling him in the process. Confronted by Angier, Olivia
                            gives him a copy of Borden's encoded diary. Angier acquires the keyword to decode it,
                            "TESLA", by threatening to kill Fallon.

                        <h3>Insomnia</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the small fishing town of Nightmute, Alaska, 17-year-old Kay Connell is found murdered.
                            Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are sent to
                            assist the local police with their investigation, at the request of police chief Nyback, an
                            old colleague of Dormer's. Ellie Burr, a young local detective who is also a fan of Dormer's
                            investigative work, picks them up when they arrive. Back in Los Angeles, Internal Affairs is
                            investigating one of Dormer's past cases. Flying to Alaska, Eckhart reveals that he is going
                            to testify against Dormer in exchange for immunity, to which Dormer responds that many
                            criminals whom he helped to convict using questionable evidence could go free if their cases
                            are reopened.

                            Dormer tracks the murderer to the scene of the crime, but the suspect flees into the fog,
                            shooting one of the police officers through the leg. Dormer spots a figure in the fog and
                            fires with his backup weapon. Rushing to the fallen figure, Dormer picks up a .38 pistol the
                            suspect has dropped. He then discovers that he has shot and killed Eckhart. Because of
                            Eckhart's pending testimony, Dormer knows that Internal Affairs will never believe the
                            shooting was an accident, so he claims that Eckhart was shot by the suspect. He does not
                            mention he has the .38 pistol.Burr is put in charge of the shooting investigation, and her
                            team finds the .38 caliber bullet that hit the officer. That night, Dormer walks to an alley
                            and fires the .38 pistol into an animal carcass, then retrieves and cleans the bullet. At
                            the morgue, the pathologist hands him the bagged bullet retrieved from Eckhart's body, but
                            she is unfamiliar with its type. Dormer leaves and switches the .38 bullet for the 9 mm slug
                            from Eckhart's body.

                            Over the next few days, Dormer is plagued by insomnia, brought on by his guilt over killing
                            Eckhart and exacerbated by the perpetual daylight.

                        <h3>Inception</h3>
                        <p>
                            Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film[4][5][6] written and directed by Christopher
                            Nolan, who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. The film stars Leonardo
                            DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of
                            his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the
                            implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.[7] The ensemble cast
                            includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page,[a] Tom Hardy,
                            Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.

                            After the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page
                            treatment for a horror film envisioning "dream stealers," based on lucid dreaming.[8]
                            Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and
                            complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005's Batman Begins, 2006's The
                            Prestige, and The Dark Knight in 2008.[9] The treatment was revised over 6 months and was
                            purchased by Warner in February 2009.[10] Inception was filmed in six countries, beginning
                            in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22.[11] Its official budget was $160
                            million, split between Warner Bros. and Legendary.[12] Nolan's reputation and success with
                            The Dark Knight helped secure the film's US$100 million in advertising expenditure.

                            Inception's premiere was held in London on July 8, 2010; it was released in both
                            conventional and IMAX theaters beginning on July 16, 2010.[13][14] Inception grossed over
                            $828 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2010. Considered one of
                            the best films of the 2010s,[15] Inception received critical praise for its screenplay,
                            direction, themes, action sequences, visual effects, musical score, and ensemble cast.[16]
                            It won four Academy Awards (Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and
                            Best Visual Effects) and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original
                            Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score.

                        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
                        <p>
                            Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film co-written, directed and produced by
                            Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill
                            Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is
                            struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole
                            near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity.

                            Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a
                            script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma
                            Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst
                            Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics[4] Kip Thorne
                            was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The
                            Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Legendary Pictures
                            co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in the Panavision
                            anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in
                            Alberta (Canada), Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and
                            miniature effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.

                            Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United
                            States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors.
                            The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million (and $701 million with subsequent
                            re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar received
                            positive reviews for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score,
                            acting, and ambition. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best
                            Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound
                            Editing and Best Production Design.
